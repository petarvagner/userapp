# User App üßë‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

### TO DO:
#### Requirements

To perform this task, you will need to use the following technologies:

* Laravel 10
* InertiaJS
* VueJS 3
* TailwindCSS

### The Task

We require you to build a simple Laravel application that will allow a user to log in or register, and update their details. They should be able to update these details through a web interface as well as an API request.

A user must have:

* Name
* Email
* Password
* Rules

**Please do not use Laravel Jetstream for this task, we want to see what you can do - not see if you can initialize a package correctly.**

You can use whichever packages aid you in the development of this task, as long as they aren‚Äôt doing the task for you.

### The Extended Task

An extended task would be to allow these users to generate API tokens as well.

### Time Allocation

Take as much time as you require for this task, we want to see your process - not a ticket just being pushed through the process. The sooner you get this done the sooner we are able to assess and move the process forward, but do not feel that this is a first come first serve situation.

### Access

Provide your submission to us in a git repository complete with a README containing setup instructions. Please do not send us a link to a public repository, as this can then become a source of plagiarism for future candidates. Please invite JustSteveKing, once you are ready, on GitHub so that your submission can be processed.

### Feedback

Where possible we will try and ensure that we provide feedback on all applicants, even if not successful. We are firm believers in investing in peoples growth.

### Next Steps

The next step after this task will be an interview with someone from our Engineering team, so that we can have a conversation about the role, culture, and ask any questions we might have from your task submission.
